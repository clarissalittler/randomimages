# randomimages
Little repo for generating semi-random images.

I'm not entirely sure what I want yet, but I think I basically want something like small shapes
  * squares
  * circles
  * triangles
  * loops
and random colors/backgrounds to things.

There may already be a library to help with this but it'll at least be a cute exercise.
